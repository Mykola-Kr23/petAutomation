# AutotestingFirstSteps

This "pet" project - my first experiance on Automation.

About project:
I decided to test one of services, which I sometimes use. I selected food delivery service "Dominos Pizza".
I described some test scenarios:
1. Smoke test (The main user story): "User want to order some pizzas from menu page". 
2. Sanity test for one feture: "Change toppings in a pizza and order it". 
3. Also I prepared some tests for checking of display error message when input fields have incorrect value. 
In this repository you can find the file "Test_Cases_dominos_UK_example.xls", in which I had wrote test cases.

I had used next stek: Java 11, Selenium, TestNG and Allure for reports. I selected it, because this is one of the most popular for UI automation.
If you want to see how it works - https://youtu.be/EQzTK3RUsCM.
I am just a beginner, therefore I could made some mistakes or inaccurated in same cases. And, I always thank for good advice.
